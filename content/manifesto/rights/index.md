<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Everyone has access to affordable education, Internet, healthcare and financial systems</span>

<p>
Through education, people can improve the living standards for themselves and for their children. Education is the gateway to a better life.
For more than 3 billion people in the world today above mentioned digital commodities are not available nor affordable. Cost of the information system needs to be lower.row.

<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Everyone has equal chances</span>

<p>
Independent of location, race, gender, religion, etc. leaving no one behind. Everyone can deliver services or products to everyone in all transparency and fairness.
Everyone should charge fair costs in relation to their added value. It's not acceptable that a poor farmer receives only 5% of the price we pay for the product in the shop. This is neither sustainable for them nor for the planet.

<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Everyone has the right to a safe, healthy, and secure environment</span>

<p>
Everyone has the right to a safe, healthy, and secure environment
Safety and health are human rights. Feeling safe is crutial for our well-being as individuals. Our money and personal information needs to be protected. Systems need to be safe & healthy (e.g. current 5G is potentially harmful).
