<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Information is Owned by the Author(s)</span>

<p>
We have sole ownership of our created information/content (e.g. photos, text, videos).
“We” can be an organization (company, government, etc) or a person. 
</p>

<br>


<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Everyone has Control over Their own Information and Community Circles</span>

<p>
We define the circles (groups of people) we want to communicate with.
We have absolute freedom to decide what we want to share, and with whom we want to share it.
We can at any point in time retrieve/destroy our information or revoke access rights.
</p>

{% end %}

{% row(style="left narrow" padding="bottom") %}

<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Information Cannot be Changed or Read Without the Consent of the Author(s)</span>

<p>
No one has access to our information unless we have given explicit access rights.
It should be technically impossible for a hacker or other organization to change information and represent it in another way than originally intended.
</p>


<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Information can be Verified</span>

<p>
We can ask for verification of the information at any point in time.
We can track to the author unless the author wants to be anonymous but then we know the source does not want to be known. In other words we don’t fake authorship or hide behind fake accounts.
</p>

<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> We Define Which Information We Want to Search for and the Search Results are not Manipulated</span>

<p>
We have the ability to search and consume information in freedom and neutrality.
We don’t like that an AI (Artificial Intelligence) machine decides what information gets priority or is blocked. Today we navigate in a restricted information world, much smaller than we believe. Keeping us uninformed and manipulating the information which is being presented to us can influence our consumption and voting actions.
</p>

<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight:bold; line-height:1.2em;"> Law Enforcement Access to Information is Important but Should not be Abused

<p>
Safety is important. Governments or law enforcement agencies should be able to access information when required in all transparency (means authors know what rights governments have and when exercised) and for the right reason.
This access should never be abused for other reasons as public safety.
This right should not lead to unnecessary censorship.
</p>
