This journey began with the creation of a new Internet infrastructure layer, a process that took over 20 years â€“ and was made possible by the contributions of thousands of people. Thank you to everyone who has made this possible.

Our co-founders also have experience running <u>[__Incubaid__](https://incubaid.com)</u>, a successful incubator focused primarily on helping to change our planet for the better through technology that supports decentralization. Over 19 years, Incubaid did seven exits totaling more than $500 million.

ThreeFold Tech has successfully created cutting-edge technology for an upgraded Internet and digital twin technology with an embedded ultra scaleable financial system.

The ThreeFold Grid, which deploys this technology in an open-source model, has been active for years and is also in its third generation. The community continues to add capacity and use it on a daily basis, as seen on the ThreeFold Grid explorer statistics.

We have signed a heads of terms agreement with a government for the implementation of a digital freezone utilizing our technology, and are getting closer to sign with another government with a population of 60 million people that is set to follow suit in the second half of 2023 for the creation of a new Internet and digital backbone.

We have also completed all necessary preparations for the launch of our digital twin, the freeflow twin, which can be viewed on the website [freeflow.life](https://www.freeflow.life/). This venture is ready to launch and is eagerly anticipated by the community.

There are multiple ventures waiting to be born as more funding comes in to use our technology and provide value for large communities.
